Implementation of an Answer Set Programming program that solve the Flow Free game


Flow Free is a addictive simple puzzle game. This game is available for both Android (https://goo.gl/eyyeE) and iPhone (https://goo.gl/BMccL). The goal is to connect matching colors with pipe to create a flow. While connecting the colored dots, the entire board has to be covered (each cell in the grid must be assigned to a color). Moreover, pipes can not intersect each other!

The goal of this homework is to model this game as a constrained problem through ASP.

This is homework is done during "Artificial Intelligence 2" course (2015/2016) at Sapienza University of Rome
